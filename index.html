                     Volunteering can be difficult when you have a busy schedule.
                     Replate makes that easy, showing you amazing opportunities in your
                     area

                        Restaurants create pick-up requests that volunteers can
                        accept. Each pick-up contains left over food and gets
                        delivered to an organization that can put it to good use.

                     <p>
                        While all of the pick-ups are volunteer work, users are
                        able to track their delivery statistics and share their
                        stats with others. Users can also earn achievements based
                        on milestones and the amount of time spent using Replate.
